# Relative Pose Policy Node

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

Standalone Dora policy node for the Forge Query endpoint `motion.relative_pose/resolve`. It consumes
`forge_msgs.JointState` locally, computes FK through `forge-kinematics`, and returns source and
absolute target poses over the Forge Tool Wire. It has no dependency on `forge-motion-server`.

The process uses the same Endpoint/domain-service layering as the Motion Action provider:

```text
Forge Query Tool Wire
        -> RelativePoseQueryEndpoint
        -> RelativePoseResolver
             -> JointStateCache
             -> ForwardKinematics
             -> frame transform
```

`RelativePoseQueryEndpoint` owns only Forge deadlines, strict wire argument parsing, `ToolResult`
serialization, and Tool/domain error translation. `RelativePoseResolver` is independent of
`forge_tool`; it owns state snapshots, FK, frame validation, and relative-to-absolute pose math.
Both objects are deliberately composed in one Dora policy-node process because resolution is a
short, one-shot query. A separate `RelativeQueryServer` process would add no execution or failure
boundary.

## Node, Endpoint and Tool API

| Item | Current implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Production Nodes | 1: `relative_pose_policy`; source command `forge-relative-motion-policy`; packaged entrypoint is defined in `scripts/build_pyinstaller.sh` |
| Tool integration | Dora `ToolMessage` provider; caller-facing access through Gateway |
| Direct HTTP Tool API | 0; this Node does not listen on HTTP; Gateway owns the invocation URL |
| Endpoints | 1: `motion.relative_pose` |
| Operations | 1: `resolve` (Query, maximum concurrency 1) |
| Gateway Tools | Deployment-defined in `tools.specs`; this repository fixes no external Tool ID and does not automatically add a robot-control-sim Tool |

Invocation mapping: `<tool_id from tools.specs> -> motion.relative_pose / resolve -> relative_pose_policy`.
The Query reads `joint_state` and resolves a relative pose to an absolute target; it sends no motion goal.
An orchestrator must invoke a separate Motion Action to move. Resolution and the subsequent Action are not atomic.

For complete arguments, results, frames/units, state freshness and errors, see [TOOL_CONTRACTS.md](TOOL_CONTRACTS.md).
Implementation: [query.py](src/relative_pose_policy_node/query.py).

Compatibility: current dependency declarations are `dora-rs>=1.0.1,<2`, `forge-kinematics>=2.0.0,<3`, `forge-msgs>=2.0.0,<3`. See [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) and [uv.lock](uv.lock). The Tool protocol implementation comes from the official `forge-tool[dora]` distribution. These declarations do not guarantee cross-version interoperability; also check the build revision and Skill lock when using artifacts.

Changes to Node entrypoints, Endpoints or Tool APIs must update this section and the associated configuration/contracts. Follow the [Node README contract](https://github.com/PhyAgentOS/forge/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#node-readme-contract).

## Install and run

Forge packages resolve from public package indexes (`forge-msgs>=2.0.0,<3`, `forge-kinematics>=2.0.0,<3`); the Forge Tool protocol is vendored under `src/forge_tool`:

```bash
uv sync
uv run forge-relative-motion-policy --config relative_pose_policy.yaml
```

Configuration supports a single kinematic group (the original format, unchanged) or multiple
groups. With no top-level `groups` key, the original single-group format applies:

```yaml
group_name: arm
joint_names: [joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4, joint5, joint6]
urdf_path: ../robots/piper.urdf
base_frame: base_link
tip_frame: link6
```

When a top-level `groups` mapping is present, each key is a group name and each value holds exactly
`joint_names`, `urdf_path`, `base_frame`, and `tip_frame`. All groups share one incoming `joint_state`
stream; resolution dispatches on `group_name`:

```yaml
groups:
  xlerobot_left_arm:
    joint_names: [left_arm_shoulder_pan, left_arm_shoulder_lift, left_arm_elbow_flex, left_arm_wrist_flex, left_arm_wrist_roll]
    urdf_path: ../assets/urdf/xlerobot_kinematics.urdf
    base_frame: base_link
    tip_frame: left_arm_tcp
  xlerobot_right_arm:
    joint_names: [right_arm_shoulder_pan, right_arm_shoulder_lift, right_arm_elbow_flex, right_arm_wrist_flex, right_arm_wrist_roll]
    urdf_path: ../assets/urdf/xlerobot_kinematics.urdf
    base_frame: base_link
    tip_frame: right_arm_tcp
```

Mixing top-level single-group fields with `groups` is rejected, as are empty `groups`, duplicated or
empty joint lists, joints shared between groups, and unknown fields. Relative `urdf_path` values
resolve against the configuration file's directory in both formats. Unknown or missing configuration
fields are rejected.

## Dora ports

Inputs:

- `joint_state`: `forge_msgs.JointState`, cached only in-process using policy receive time.
- `tool_in`: Forge `ToolMessage` envelopes, including registry responses and Query requests.
- any regular input (for example `tick`) can drive lease renewal.

Output:

- `tool_out`: registration/unregistration, Query responses, and Tool errors.

The runner composes `RelativePoseQueryEndpoint`, `RelativePoseResolver`, Forge's public
`ToolEndpointHandler`, and `DoraToolEndpointBinding`; it does not duplicate Tool Wire dispatch. One
endpoint-level `EndpointLease` registers and renews the descriptor. See
[TOOL_CONTRACTS.md](TOOL_CONTRACTS.md) for the strict request and result contract.

The PAOS-owned MuJoCo integration graph lives in the `move-arm-by-ee` Skill of the
PhyAgentOS skill collection.


## Development

Use Python 3.12 and `uv`:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --all-groups
uv run pytest -q
```

The vendored `forge-tool` protocol under `src/forge_tool` is resolved
automatically; see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for its provenance. The optional
standalone executable can be built with `scripts/build_pyinstaller.sh`.

## Forge 2.x migration

This branch prepares node version `2.0.0` for Dora 1.x, frozen to Dora `1.0.1` for migration validation. It uses the official Forge 2.x distributions; Common is at least `2.1.0`. Regenerated locks and all executable entrypoints are part of the change.

Every change report must list repository, changes and test evidence, including per-node `dora run` records and a chained test containing `adapter-forge-gateway`. Unavailable hardware/model checks remain pending. Source PRs do not publish stable releases or synchronize GitLab; synchronization follows full acceptance.

ToolEndpoint implementations now come from `forge-tool[dora]>=2.0.0,<3`. The former repository-local Tool copy and private message imports are removed; messages use the public `forge_msgs.ToolMessage`.
