# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to the Relative Pose Policy Node.

## Development

Use Python 3.12 and `uv`:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --all-groups
uv run pytest -q
uv run forge-relative-motion-policy --help
```

The vendored `forge-tool` protocol under `src/forge_tool` is resolved
automatically by the pytest configuration and the package init; it needs no
environment setup. Keep changes focused and add tests for behavior changes.
Keep the Query endpoint and resolver layers separate: `RelativePoseResolver`
must stay independent of `forge_tool`.

## Security and generated data

- Report vulnerabilities privately as described in `SECURITY.md`.
- Never commit credentials, private repository URLs, recordings, runtime state,
  machine-specific paths, or personal data.
- Do not run tests that command physical hardware without independent safety
  controls and an operator-accessible emergency stop.
